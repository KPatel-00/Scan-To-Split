## 1. The Vision
**"The Ultimate Premium Bill Splitting Experience"**

ScanToSplit.ai is not just a utility; it is a statement piece in the fintech space. We have rejected the industry standard of clunky, spreadsheet-like bill splitters in favor of an experience that feels as premium as the dining experiences it settles.

By marrying **Google's Gemini AI** with an **"Apple-grade" design philosophy**, we have created an intelligent financial assistant that transforms a moment of social friction—paying the bill—into a moment of delight.

**Core Promise:** "Scan. Split. Done."

## 2. The Problem
In the current market, splitting bills is a broken experience:
*   **Manual Entry is Painful:** Typing in 20+ items from a receipt is tedious and error-prone.
*   **"Even Splits" are Unfair:** Splitting a $200 dinner equally when one person only had a salad creates resentment.
*   **Multiple Bills are Messy:** Managing a weekend trip with receipts from dinner, drinks, and taxis usually requires a complex spreadsheet.
*   **Existing Apps Feel Cheap:** Competitors are often ad-heavy, cluttered, and lack visual polish.

## 3. The Solution
ScanToSplit.ai offers a "Zero-Friction" solution:
1.  **AI-First:** We don't ask you to type. We ask you to take a picture. Our AI reads the receipt, understands the items, and categorizes them instantly.
2.  **Context-Aware:** We handle single dinners ("Merged Mode") and weekend trips ("Separate Mode") with equal elegance.
3.  **Premium Feel:** We use "Glassmorphism," fluid physics-based animations, and tactile feedback to make the app feel like a native extension of a high-end device.

## 4. Target Audience
*   **The Social Organizer:** The person in the friend group who always handles the bill and wants a tool that is fast, fair, and impressive.
*   **Travelers:** Groups needing to manage expenses across multiple days and locations.
*   **Roommates:** People sharing household expenses who need a quick, fair way to split grocery runs.
